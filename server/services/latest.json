It's a 27-kilometer ring of superconducting magnets used to accelerate and collide beams of particles, primarily protons, at extremely high energies. This allows scientists to study the fundamental building blocks of matter and the forces that govern the universe, simulating conditions similar to those shortly after the Big Bang.",
