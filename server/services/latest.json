Demand is seasonally strong, but refinery maintenance has tightened supply.\n\n📈 Why it matters:\n\nSummer driving season = higher fuel demand\n\nLower inventories = price pressure upward\n\nFed interest rate trajectory = affects demand outlook\n\n🔍 What to watch:\n\nU.S. inventory reports (API & EIA)\n\nHurricane season risks\n\nGlobal demand signals from China & India\n\n💬 Investor Insight: Energy stocks like XOM (ExxonMobil), CVX (Chevron), and SLB (Schlumberger) remain solid plays as oil stabilizes.

    "text": "The Crooked FoxNews Polls got the Election WRONG, I won by much more than they said I would, and have been biased against me for years. They are always wrong and negative. It’s why MAGA HATES FoxNews, even though their anchors are GREAT. This has gone on for years, but they never change the incompetent polling company that does their work. Now a new FoxNews poll comes out this morning giving me a little more than 50% at the Border, and yet the Border is miraculously perfect, NOBODY WAS ABLE TO COME IN LAST MONTH. 60,000 people came in with Sleepy Joe in the same month last year. I hate FAKE pollsters, one of the Worst, but Fox will never change their discredited pollster!\n2.13k\n3.15k\n14.9k",
